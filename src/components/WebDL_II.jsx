        After I had finished with level 1, I started level 2 by doing a few
        touch-ups on my HTML, CSS, and JS skills. After that, I started learning
        how to use a special app called Visual Studio Code. It made coding much
        easier than the built in sandbox from the CY home website. I used this
        website to learn about a new type of styling system called Bootstrap.
        Bootstrap was a refined version of CSS that could be imported onto your
        works and makes styling simpler, neater and nicer. After I learned the
        use of Bootstrap, I switched to using a platform called React on VS
        Code. React was a safer and new way for me to build my works and made it
        simpler in general by pointing out my mistakes and allowing me to import
        more tools such as Router Dom, Axios, etc. But at first I started with
        how React Bootstrap actually did its job. After I learned how it worked,
        I started using about adding components as separate and reusable files.
        Afterwards I learned special functions that React provided, such as
        useState, which stores a changeable value at anytime, or map, which
        would display the data from objects with same attribute names with less
        code instead of repeating everything. It started to get more complex
        from here but it was ok. I also learned about how to add routes to my
        website, which were little additions to the url that would guide you to
        showing a new webpage from the same site, which would display one
        component per route. Towards the end of my career, I learned about
        fetching data from APIs and using Axios to do so. I used map functions
        to help me lay out the data of different people such as all of their
        names, emails, addresses, etc. I had multiple assessments throughout
        both WebDL 1 and 2, and they would be regarding the recently taught
        mechanics of website building.
